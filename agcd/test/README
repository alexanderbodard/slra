This directory contains the tests for the AGCD paper.

In order to run the tests:
1) NACLAB (containing UVGCD) should be installed in the directory uvgcd. 

NACLAB can be downloaded from http://homepages.neiu.edu/~naclab/

2) FASTGCD should be installed in the directory fastgcd

This is done by running the script 'install_fastgcd.m'
