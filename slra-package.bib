  abstract = {The structured total least squares estimator, defined via a constrained optimization problem, is a generalization of the total least squares estimator when the data matrix and the applied correction satisfy given structural constraints. In the paper, an affine structure with additional assumptions is considered. In particular, Toeplitz and Hankel structured, noise free and unstructured blocks are allowed simultaneously in the augmented data matrix. An equivalent optimization problem is derived that has as decision variables only the estimated parameters. The cost function of the equivalent problem is used to prove consistency of the structured total least squares estimator. The results for the general affine structured multivariate model are illustrated by examples of special models. Modification of the results for block-Hankel/Toeplitz structures is also given. As a by-product of the analysis of the cost function, an iterative algorithm for the computation of the structured total least squares estimator is proposed.},

  abstract = {The structured low-rank approximation problem for general affine structures, weighted 2-norms and fixed elements is considered. The variable projection principle is used to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization problem. Algorithms for evaluation of the cost function, the gradient and an approximation of the Hessian are developed. For $m\times n$ mosaic Hankel matrices the algorithms have complexity $O(m^2n)$.},
