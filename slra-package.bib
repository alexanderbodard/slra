  abstract = {The structured total least squares estimator, defined via a constrained optimization problem, is a generalization of the total least squares estimator when the data matrix and the applied correction satisfy given structural constraints. In the paper, an affine structure with additional assumptions is considered. In particular, Toeplitz and Hankel structured, noise free and unstructured blocks are allowed simultaneously in the augmented data matrix. An equivalent optimization problem is derived that has as decision variables only the estimated parameters. The cost function of the equivalent problem is used to prove consistency of the structured total least squares estimator. The results for the general affine structured multivariate model are illustrated by examples of special models. Modification of the results for block-Hankel/Toeplitz structures is also given. As a by-product of the analysis of the cost function, an iterative algorithm for the computation of the structured total least squares estimator is proposed.},

  abstract = {The structured low-rank approximation problem for general affine structures, weighted 2-norms and fixed elements is considered. The variable projection principle is used to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization problem. Algorithms for evaluation of the cost function, the gradient and an approximation of the Hessian are developed. For $m\times n$ mosaic Hankel matrices the algorithms have complexity $O(m^2n)$.},

  abstract = {A software package is presented that computes locally optimal solutions to low-rank approximation problems with the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em mosaic Hankel structure\/} constraint on the approximating matrix,
\item {\em weighted 2-norm\/} approximation criterion,
\item {\em fixed elements\/} in the approximating matrix,
\item {\em missing elements\/} in the data matrix, and
\item {\em linear constraints\/} on an approximating matrix's left kernel basis.
\end{itemize}
It implements a variable projection type algorithm and allows the user to choose standard local optimization methods for the solution of the parameter optimization problem. For an $m\times n$ data matrix, with $n>m$, the computational complexity of the cost function and derivative evaluation is~$O(m^2n)$. The package is suitable for applications with $n\gg m$. In statistical estimation and data modeling---the main application areas of the package---$n\gg m$ corresponds to modeling of large amount of data by a low-complexity model. Performance results on benchmark system identification problems from the database DAISY and approximate common divisor problems are presented.},
